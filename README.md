# Setup

## 0. Getting setup with git version control and running bash scripts.

It may be worthwhile for Windows users to install a [github for windows](https://desktop.github.com/), which should come with Git Shell. 

If you are a Mac user, you *might* need XCode's [Command Line Package](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) which allows for command line development in OSX. 

*Note: you do not need the XCode app to get these developer tools.* 

In order to install the package, run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal. If you get an error, you can troubleshoot and learn more about the package [here](https://developer.apple.com/opensource/).

## 1. Cloning the Repo

Run `git clone https://github.com/yaleqc/qiskit_surface_codes.git` to clone this repo. 

## 2. Install Miniconda (optional, but highly recommended)

As with many projects, it may be useful to set up a package manager **and** environment manager. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#:~:text=Miniconda%20is%20a%20free%20minimal,zlib%20and%20a%20few%20others.) is a free, minimal installer for [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) which servers as **both** a package and environment manager! 

You don't have to use miniconda, but we highly recommend it. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) for your operating system. Then, you should be able to run `conda -h` in your bash shell successfully. If this doesn't work, make sure to add miniconda to your [path](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#windows_4).

## 3. Set up conda environment

Once you are able to successfully run `conda -h`, run `conda create --name qiskit-surface-code-env python=3` to create a virtual environment. Afterward, run `conda activate qiskit-surface-code-env` to activate the environment. The required packages can be installed by executing the following commands sequentially:

1. `conda install numpy scipy matplotlib networkx ipykernel tqdm`
2. `pip install qiskit pylatexenc`

## 4. Run the tutorials

Next, use Jupyter, Visual Studio Code or your favorite notebook environment to open the tutorial notebooks. If all tutorial notebooks execute correctly without error, your environment is good to go!

# About / History
## IBM Qiskit - Summer Jam Hackathon 2020

Quantum computation is an inherently noisy process. Scalable quantum computers will require fault-tolerance to implement useful computation. There are many proposed approaches to this, but one promising candidate is the family of *topological quantum error correcting codes*.

Currently, the [`qiskit.ignis.verification.topological_codes`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/verification.html#topological-codes) module provides a general framework for QEC and implements one specific example, the *repetition code*.

For the hackathon, our team [Erwin's Tigers](#team) implemented a **surface code encoder and decoder** for Qiskit Ignis. We hope that this implementation will be useful to other Qiskitters and will inspire others to continue building out the `topological_codes` module into a diverse family.

## Usage
Inspired by the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/error-correction-repetition-code.html), we've written a full set of [jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/Phionx/qiskit_surface_codes/tree/master/tutorials), which are the best way to get up to speed. They detail both the API and the gritty implementation details -- please check them out!

## Background

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="surface code teaser" src="tutorials/img/error_set.jpg">
</p>

Surface codes are a type of CSS code, consisting of pairwise commuting X and Z stabilizers made of Pauli gates. It defines a logical state on a 2 by 2 lattice made of quantum bits with the stabilizers X<sub>1</sub> X<sub>2</sub> Z<sub>1</sub> Z<sub>2</sub>.

The code is based on the earlier theoretical idea of a *toric code*, with periodic boundary conditions instead of open boundary conditions. This has been shown to be largely identical, but embedding a surface code on an actual device is much easier.

## Implementation

In general, we try to follow the existing structure of [`qiskit.ignis.verification.topological_codes`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/verification.html#topological-codes). The code is implemented separately here but is able to easily be merged into Ignis.

There are two main interfaces â€” corresponding to the encoder and decoder, respectively:

### `SurfaceCode` in [`surface_code.circuits`](surface_code/circuits.py)

`SurfaceCode(d, T)` generates a `QuantumCircuit` for creating a logical state and measuring stabilizers. The class is parameterized with the code distance `d` (which should be odd) and the number of syndrome measurement rounds `T` (usually `T = d`). This class also handles parsing of the physical device readout into a form suitable for decoding. Please see the [encoder tutorial](tutorials/1_surface_code_encoding.ipynb) for a full walkthrough.

</p>

### `GraphDecoder` in [`surface_code.fitters`](surface_code/fitters.py)

`GraphDecoder(d, T)` implements minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) on the syndrome measurements of the physical circuit. This class is similar to the existing `GraphDecoder` for repetition codes, but introduces a new framework to handle the 2D lattice.

Parsed readout from the device is used to generate graphs of *error chains* in time and space, which decode syndrome measurements into the most likely sequence of qubit flips over time. Please see the [decoder tutorial](tutorials/2_surface_code_decoding.ipynb) for a full walkthrough.

## Future Directions
The scope of the project is quite large, so we focused on completing a "minimum viable product" during the hackathon. However, there are many areas which we'd like to explore going forward. A few immediate ones:

* Expand `SurfaceCode(d, T).circuits` a full set of logical states (1, +, -) -- and ultimately logical gate operations for computation.
* Full benchmark of the physical-error to logical-error probabilities to determine the error correction threshold.
* More simulation runs: different X/Z error probabilities, more limited `coupling_map`, etc.
* Our MWPM matching already has the below improvements to the basic algorithm, but are there more?
  * For a given pair of syndromes, there may be many possible error chains through space and time. We compute this "path degeneracy" and use it to re-weight the error probabilities.
  * We cross-match X and Z errors to produce an overall Y error. However, this doesn't exactly match a depolarizing channel, so ideally the weights would be re-adjusted with conditional probabilities.
* Other approaches to error-chain matching (e.g. [neural networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aa955a/meta) or [tensor networks](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.90.032326))?
* Our `GraphDecoder` implements two different approaches to syndrome graph generation. One is a "analytic" approach (much faster), and the other uses simulation to insert errors into the circuit. These produce slightly different syndrome graphs, but we get the same decoding results in our tests.
